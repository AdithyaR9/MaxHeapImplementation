# MaxHeapImplementation

Created March 2020

This is my implementation of the Maximum Heap data structure.

I have utilized an interface for my class implementation, and I have also included a program ('MainFile') that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Maximum Heap using all the associated functions.

Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors (class implements interface)
